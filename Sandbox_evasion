2. Geolocation
One defining factor of Sandboxes is that they are often located off-premise and are hosted by Anti-Virus providers. If you know you are attacking TryHackMe, a European company, and your binary is executed in California, you can make an educated guess that the binary has ended up in a Sandbox. You may choose to implement a geolocation filter on your program that checks if the IP Address block is owned by the company you are targeting or if it is from a residential address space. There are several services that you can use to check this information:

ifconfig.me
